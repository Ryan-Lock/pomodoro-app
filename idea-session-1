youtube/music listening thing (youtube embedded video? I wanted to be able to search up a youtube video but idk how functionality works)
timer (just time shown? stopwatch design?)
choice of background? some kind of background
ability to show local weather
figured it could all be on one page if it works
task checklist
Estimate number of pomodoro sessions to complete tasks (user inputs time they think it will take to complete tasks)
Record of sessions completed?
Save tasks so user can come back to session and see tasks completed/not completed
in browser
clock

To do: 
Think about how we want the page to look
Think about how we individually want each feature to look/be implemented (get a bit more specific)
save any resources you find that might help implement features and post 'em up
how are ideas being implemented? brainstorm what you want and then come back together to share it collectively
